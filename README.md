# Verilog-Calculator
Calculator project for ECE 5623 using DE10-Lite. Meets design requirements listed below. It was the final project of ECE 5623, but it is not exactly a TI calculator... 

Using the UART project, a rudimentary calculator was created on the eval board. The computer terminal transmitted an operation (+ for addition, - for subtraction, < for left shift, and > for right shift) to modify the currect value displayed by the FPGA. Addition and subtraction operations were followed by an integer (0-9), while left shift and right shift were implemented automatically. Inputs following addition and subtraction must be integers, or they were ignored. Left shift and right shift operations were limited by the registers maximum values for signed integers - additional logic was implemented to prevent any accidental rollovers.
